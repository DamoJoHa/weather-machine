This is a little React app meant to take a flight number and return to the user a forecast for the time and place of both departure and landing.  
Inspired by the shellshock of bording a plane in a sunny-warm place and disembarking in the snow.

Notes:


This app only currently works with upcoming flights (does not check past flights or flights in progress).
Additionally, this only works for US flights at the moment, because it relies on a weather API maintained by the US government.

Its also *very* ugly.  Best to view this as a proof of concept.  Maybe could be useful in the future as a part of a larger flight planning app?

(All of this relies on a RapidAPI key, which is not included in the git repo for obvious reasons.)
