Notes:

This app only currently works with upcoming flights (does not check past flights or flights in progress).
Additionally, this only works for US flights at the moment, because it relies on a weather API maintained by the US government.

Its also *very* ugly.  Best to view this as a proof of concept.  Maybe could be useful in the future as a part of a larger flight planning app?

(All of this relies on a RapidAPI key, which is not included in the git repo for obvious reasons.)
